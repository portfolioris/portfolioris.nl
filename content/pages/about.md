      # Hi, I am Joris,


      Front-end UI developer from Eindhoven, the Netherlands. I specialize in responsive Web design and styleguides. I am a performance, progressive enhancement and accessibility advocate. I write clean, readable and scalable code to create beautiful online experiences for all users.


      My current employer is [We are you](https://www.weareyou.com), a digital agency in the Netherlands, where I work with clients like Vesteda, Van Lanschot, Dunea, Vitens and Evides. Before, I worked at digital agency [Partout d.n.a.](https://www.partout.nl/), for clients like Koopmans, Dr. Oetker, Weleda and Longfonds.


      I have a background in arts, graphic design, audiovisual design, animation, marketing, communication. I studied audiovisual design at St. Joost Academy in Breda, Communication and Design at SintLucas in Boxtel, and Interactive Media at Hogeschool van Amsterdam.
